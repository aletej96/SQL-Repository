# SQL Project Repository

## Project Description
This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts and utilities designed to demonstrate advanced SQL functionalities and data manipulation techniques. The scripts are developed for connecting to and interacting with a cloud-based AWS database, showcasing real-world applications of SQL in data analysis and database management.

## Features
- **Complex Queries**: Including SELECT, JOIN, and subqueries to fetch and analyze data from multiple tables simultaneously.
- **Data Manipulation**: Scripts for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE to manage data within the database effectively.
- **Data Definition**: Utilizing CREATE, ALTER, and DROP to structure and modify database schemas.
- **Transaction Control**: Implementing BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Performance Optimization**: Examples of INDEX creation and query optimization techniques to improve performance.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS RDS**: All scripts are configured to connect to an AWS RDS instance, ensuring scalable and secure database management in the cloud.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Depending on the branch, scripts are compatible with PostgreSQL or MySQL, two of the most popular relational database management systems.

## Setup and Installation
To run these scripts, you'll need access to an AWS RDS instance and the necessary credentials. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:

2. **Install Python dependencies** (if necessary for your setup):


3. **Set up your database connection**:
- Modify the provided configuration files or scripts to include your AWS database credentials and connection details.

## Usage
To execute the SQL scripts:
1. Connect to your AWS database using a SQL client (im using DBeaver btw) or a script setup for database connections.
2. Run the SQL scripts you are interested in. Each script is standalone and contains comments explaining the purpose and functionality.
